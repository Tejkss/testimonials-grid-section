          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more
          so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

          transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
          the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next
          12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course,
          I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.”

          Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from
          them and learning from their experiences was easy.

          Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!

          “Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure
          from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to
          enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
          The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never
          had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding.
          It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact,
          I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
          certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
          100% recommend!”
